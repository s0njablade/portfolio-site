# portfolio-site
I thought it would be a good idea to create a "starter" portfolio site where I can showcase different projects that I have worked on. 
## Layout
At the moment there are 2 pages: homepage and projects. I have commented out an "about me" page in the nav bar, with the inention of going in and adding to it later. My reasoning for that is, I am not sure what I want to do with the homepage right now. Once I have a little more knowledge, I can add some flare to the homepage and move the content within it to the "about me" page.
## Built With
I used bootstrap for my nav bar. Used flexbox where necessary and created the rest with html and css.
